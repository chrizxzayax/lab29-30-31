1) Header crash when CSV had header text.
   Fix: load_initial_data now detects and skips a header line before parsing.

2) Using non-portable <bits/stdc++.h>.
   Fix: replaced with explicit standard includes for portability.

3) RNG inconsistency (mix of rand() and mt19937).
   Fix: removed rand(); all random draws use seeded std::mt19937.

4) Alpha used a short 3-year default (confusing).
   Fix: Beta default is 12 years; CLI allows shorter for quick tests.

5) Parsing malformed numeric fields crashed the loader.
   Fix: added try/catch around stoi/stod and skip malformed lines.
