Project Overview:
this project creates a clownfish environment simulation being affected by pollution for 12 years. the software's idea is to demonstrate
the imminent damage and possible extinction of an often overlooked part of our planet, the coral reefs across the world and one of its
most delicate species, the clownfish. Is important to try to understand the gravity of the imbalance of nature that we keep prolonging

Implementation
the primary container will be std::map<string, std::list<clownfish>, 3>>
	map key
	map value an std::array containing three std::lists: index 0: juveniles < 6 months
						             index 1: Adults 6-60 months
							     index 2: seniors > 60 months

-clownfish variable example: id, agemonths, health (0-1), tolerance to pollution (0-1)

-environment: waterquality, companion std::map<string, ZoneEnv>

-time period rate (steps) monthly discrete events. total simulation length is 12 years


simulation processes (per step)

	updateenvironment, adjust waterquality
	simulate mortality, compute and apply mortality per fish
	simulate reproduction, adults produce juveniles and depends on waterquality and local crowding
	age and transfer, increment fish ages and move individuals among three std::lists when they cross the treshholds (juvenile, adult, senior)
	maymigrate, an extra variable (might not add)
	printreport (snapshot) monthly neatly display the current map state perzone, age class and waterquality and sample individuals.
